<h1>Decision tree prediction web application</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is an interactive decision tree visualization tool for predicting suitability for outdoor activities based on weather conditions. This application demonstrates the principles of the decision tree algorithm, a fundamental concept in machine learning. Through intuitive visualization and interactive features, users can better understand how decision trees make predictions based on different input conditions. </p>

<h2>Installation and Setup Guide</h2>
<h3>Environmental requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modern web browser (supports HTML5, CSS3 and ES6+)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the entire HTML file to your computer. </li>
<li>Open the HTML file using a modern web browser. </li>
<li>No additional installation steps are required, the page will automatically load all necessary scripts and styles. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions for use</h2>
<h3>Operation steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select weather conditions from the left control panel:</li>
<li>Weather outlook (sunny, cloudy, rainy)</li>
<li>Temperature (hot, mild, cool)</li>
<li>Humidity (high, normal)</li>
<li>Wind (yes, no)</li>
<li>Click the "Generate Prediction" button to generate a prediction</li>
<li>Observe the highlighted predicted paths in the decision tree visualization area</li>
<li>Click the "Graph Explanation" button to view the chart explanation</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Select the following criteria:
- Weather outlook: Sunny
- Temperature: hot
- Humidity: high
- Wind: Yes</p>
<p>After clicking "Generate Prediction", you will see the path from the root node to the prediction result in the decision tree highlighted. </p>
<h2>Project structure</h2>
